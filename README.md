# Describing Hardware with System Verilog 

Hardware description languages (HDLs) are used to describe both the structure and behaviour of a digital logic circuit. HDL design can be passed through tools to either make a IC at a foundry or they can be mapped onto an FPGA device.

In this tutorial series we are going to learn a HDL called System Verilog and will simulate our designs with an open-source simulator called Verilator.

Each lesson will consist of:
* a short video (~10 mins)
* an exercise

At the end of this course you should be able to design your own custom digital circuits.

A lot of the examples are taken from the following books:
* Verilog by Example: A Concise Introduction for FPGA Design, by Blaine Readler
